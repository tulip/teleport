title: Running Teleport on GCP
description: How to install and configure Gravitational Teleport on GCP for SSH and Kubernetes access.
---

We've created this guide to give customers a high-level overview of how to use Teleport on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/) (GCP). This guide provides a high-level introduction leading to a deep dive into how to set up and run Teleport in production.

We have split this guide into:

- [GCP Teleport Introduction](#gcp-teleport-introduction)
- [GCP Quickstart](#quickstart)
- [Teleport on GCP FAQ](#teleport-on-gcp-faq)

## GCP Teleport introduction

This guide will cover how to set up, configure and run Teleport on GCP.

GCP Services required to run Teleport in High Availability:

- [Compute Engine: VM Instances with Instance Groups](#compute-engine-vm-instances-with-instance-groups)
- [Computer Engine: Health Checks](#computer-engine-health-checks)
- [Storage: Cloud Firestore](#storage-google-cloud-storage)
- [Storage: Google Cloud Storage](#storage-google-cloud-storage)
- [Network Services: Load Balancing](#network-services-load-balancing)
- [Network Services: Cloud DNS](#network-services-cloud-dns)

Other things needed:

- [SSL Certificate](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates)

Optional:

- Management Tools: Cloud Deployment Manager
- Stackdriver Logging

We recommend setting up Teleport in High Availability mode. In High Availability mode Firestore
stores the state of the system and Google Cloud Storage stores the audit logs.

### Compute Engine: VM instances with Instance Groups

To run Teleport in a High Availability configuration we recommend using `n1-standard-2` instances in
Production. It's best practice to separate the proxy and authentication server, using
Instance groups for the proxy and auth server.

### Computer Engine: health checks

GCP relies heavily on [Health Checks](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-checks),
this is helpful when adding new instances to an instance group.

To enable health checks in Teleport start with `teleport start --diag-addr=0.0.0.0:3000`
see  [Admin Guide: Troubleshooting](admin-guide.mdx#troubleshooting) for more information.

### Storage: Cloud Firestore

[Cloud Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) is a storage backend that uses real-time
updates to keep individual auth instances in sync and requires Firestore configured
in native mode.

Add this storage configuration in teleport section of the config file (by default it's `/etc/teleport.yaml`):

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: firestore
    collection_name: cluster-data
    project_id: EXAMPLE_gcp-proj-with-firestore-enabled
    credentials_path: /var/lib/teleport/firestore_creds.json
    audit_events_uri: ['firestore://events_table_name?projectID=example_Teleport-Project-Name&credentialsPath=/var/lib/teleport/gcs_creds.json']
```

### Storage: Google Cloud Storage

When creating the Bucket we would recommend setting it up as `Dual-region` and with
`Standard` storage class. Provide access using a `Uniform` access control with a Google-managed
key.

When setting up `audit_sessions_uri` use `gs://` session prefix.

```yaml
storage:
    ...
    audit_sessions_uri: 'gs://teleport-session-storage-2?projectID=EXAMPLE_gcp-proj-with-firestore-enabled&credentialsPath=/var/lib/teleport/gcs_creds.json'
    ...
```

### Network Services: load balancing

Load Balancing is required for Proxy and SSH traffic. Use `TCP Load Balancing` as
Teleport requires custom ports for SSH and Web Traffic.

### Network Services: Cloud DNS

Cloud DNS is used to set up the public URL of the Teleport Proxy. Once set up an `A`
record is sufficient.

### Access: Service accounts

The Authentication server will need to read and write to Firestore.  For this, it'll need the correct permission via Server Accounts. Learn how to [enable and create service accounts for instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances).

## Quickstart

### Create resources

We recommend starting by creating the resources. We highly recommend creating these using an infrastructure automation tool such as [Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/) or Terraform.

### Install and configure Teleport

Follow install instructions from our [installation page](installation.mdx#linux).

We recommend further configuring Teleport using the following steps.

## Step 1/4. Configure Teleport Auth server

Use the `teleport.yaml` below:

```yaml
#
# Sample Teleport configuration teleport.yaml file for Auth Server
#
teleport:
  nodename: teleport-auth-server
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
  pid_file: /run/teleport.pid
  auth_token: EXAMPLE-CLUSTER-JOIN-TOKEN
  auth_servers:
  - 0.0.0.0:3025
  connection_limits:
    max_connections: 15000
    max_users: 250
  log:
    output: stderr
    severity: DEBUG
  storage:
    type: firestore
    collection_name: cluster-data
    # Credentials: Path to google service account file, used for Firestore and Google Storage.
    credentials_path: /var/lib/teleport/gcs_creds.json
    project_id: example_Teleport-Project-Name
    audit_events_uri: 'firestore://events?projectID=example_Teleport-Project-Name&credentialsPath=/var/lib/teleport/gcs_creds.json'
    audit_sessions_uri: 'gs://teleport-session-storage-2?projectID=example_Teleport-Project-Name&credentialsPath=/var/lib/teleport/gcs_creds.json'
auth_service:
  enabled: yes
  auth_service:
    tokens:
    - "proxy,node:EXAMPLE-CLUSTER-JOIN-TOKEN"
```

Start it using [systemd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/master/examples/systemd/teleport.service) or use DEB/.RPM packages available from our [Downloads Page](https://gravitational.com/teleport/download/).

## Step 2/4. Setup Proxy

Save the following configuration file as `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the Proxy Server:

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_token: EXAMPLE-CLUSTER-JOIN-TOKEN
  # We recommend using a TCP load balancer pointed to the auth servers when
  # setting up in High Availability mode.
  auth_servers: [ "auth.example.com:3025" ]
  # enable ssh service and disable auth and proxy:
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Step 3/4. Setup Teleport Nodes

Save the following configuration file as `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the node:

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_token: EXAMPLE-CLUSTER-JOIN-TOKEN
  # We recommend using a TCP load balancer pointed to the auth servers when
  # setting up in High Availability mode.
  auth_servers: [ "auth.example.com:3025" ]
  # enable ssh service and disable auth and proxy:
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Step 4/4. Add users

Follow [adding users](enterprise/quickstart-enterprise.mdx#step-33-adding-users) or integrate with [Google Workspace](enterprise/sso/ssh-google-workspace.mdx) to provide SSO access.

## Teleport on GCP FAQ

### Why would you want to use Teleport with GCP?

As a [BeyondCorp](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/) leader, GCP already provides some great tools out of the box such as [Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/).

This is an excellent tool to quickly get set up securely with GCP but it can become complicated to integrate into existing workflows and complicated if you want to share
tool across clouds.

### Which services can I use Teleport with?

You can use Teleport for all the services that you would SSH into. This guide is
focused on Google Compute Engine. 

Read [adding users](enterprise/quickstart-enterprise.mdx#step-33-adding-users) or integrate with [Google Workspace](enterprise/sso/ssh-google-workspace.mdx) to provide SSO access.
