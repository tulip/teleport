description: This guide explains how to set up a Mattermost plugin for Teleport for privilege elevation approvals.
h1: Teleport Mattermost Plugin Setup

This guide will talk through how to set up Teleport with Mattermost. Teleport to Mattermost integration allows teams to approve or deny Teleport access requests using [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) an open-source messaging platform.

<Admonition type="tip">
  The Access Request workflow is now supported in both the Teleport Open Source and Enterprise Editions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have:

- Teleport Enterprise Edition.
- Admin privileges with access to [`tctl`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl).
- Mattermost account with admin privileges. This plugin has been tested with Mattermost 5.x

#### Setting up Mattermost to work with the bot	

![Enable Mattermost bots](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/mattermost_admin_console_integrations_bot_accounts.png)	

In Mattermost, go to "System Console" → "Integrations" → "Enable Bot Account Creation" → Set to `True`.	

This will allow us to create a new bot account that the Teleport bot will use. Go back to your team, then "Integrations" → "Bot Accounts" → "Add Bot Account". 

The new bot account will need the `Post All` permission.

![Enable Mattermost Bots](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/mattermost_bot.png)

##### Create an OAuth 2.0 application

In Mattermost, go to "System Console" → "Integrations" → "OAuth 2.0 Applications".

- Set "Callback URLs" to the location of your Teleport Proxy

![Create OAuth Application](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/mattermost_OAuth_token.png)

The confirmation screen after you've created the bot will give you the access token. We'll use this in the config later.

#### Create user and role for access

Log into Teleport Authentication Server, this is where you normally run `tctl`. Create a
new user and role that only has API access to the `access_request` API. The below script
will create a yaml resource file for a new user and role.

(!docs/pages/includes/permission-warning.mdx!)

```yaml
# This command will create two Teleport Yaml resources, a new Teleport user and a
# Role for that users that can only approve / list requests.
cat > rscs.yaml <<EOF
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin-mattermost
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin-mattermost']
version: v2
---
kind: role
metadata:
  name: access-plugin-mattermost
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list','read','update']
    # teleport currently refuses to issue certs for a user with 0 logins,
    # this restriction may be lifted in future versions.
    logins: ['access-plugin-mattermost']
version: v3
EOF

# Run this to create the user and role in Teleport.
tctl create -f rscs.yaml
```

#### Export access-plugin certificate

Teleport Plugin use the `access-plugin-mattermost` role and user to perform the approval. We export the identity files, using [`tctl auth sign`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl-auth-sign).

```bash
tctl auth sign --format=tls --user=access-plugin-mattermost --out=auth --ttl=2190h
# ...
```

The above sequence should result in three PEM encoded files being generated: auth.crt, auth.key, and auth.cas (certificate, private key, and CA certs respectively).  We'll reference the auth.crt, auth.key, and auth.cas files later when [configuring the plugins](#configuring-mattermost-bot).

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>
  By default, [`tctl auth sign`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl-auth-sign) produces certificates with a relatively short lifetime. For production deployments, the `--ttl` flag can be used to ensure a more practical certificate lifetime. `--ttl=24h` exports a 24-hour token.

## Downloading and installing the plugin

We recommend installing the Teleport Plugins alongside the Teleport Proxy. This is an ideal
location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and will require both public internet access
and Teleport Auth access.  We currently only provide linux-amd64 binaries, you can also
compile these plugins from [source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access/mattermost).

```bash
wget https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-mattermost-v(=teleport.plugin.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
tar -xzf teleport-access-mattermost-v(=teleport.plugin.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
cd teleport-access-mattermost
./install
which teleport-mattermost
# /usr/local/bin/teleport-mattermost
```

Run `./install` in from 'teleport-mattermost' or place the executable in the appropriate `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on the server installation.

### Configuring Mattermost bot

Mattermost Bot uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a boilerplate config by
running the following command:

```bash
sudo teleport-mattermost configure > teleport-mattermost.toml
sudo mv teleport-mattermost.toml /etc
```

Then, edit the config as needed.

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-mattermost.toml!)
```

### Testing the plugin

With the config above, you should be able to run the bot invoking `teleport-mattermost start -d`. The will provide some debug information to make sure the bot can connect to Mattermost.

```bash
sudo teleport-mattermost start -d
# DEBU   DEBUG logging enabled logrus/exported.go:117
# INFO   Starting Teleport Access Mattermost Bot (=teleport.plugin.version=)-dev.1: mattermost/main.go:140
# DEBU   Checking Teleport server version mattermost/main.go:234
# DEBU   Starting a request watcher... mattermost/main.go:296
# DEBU   Starting Mattermost API health check... mattermost/main.go:186
# DEBU   Starting secure HTTPS server on :8081 utils/http.go:146
# DEBU   Watcher connected mattermost/main.go:260
# DEBU   Mattermost API health check finished ok mattermost/main.go:19
```

### Setup with SystemD

In production, we recommend starting teleport plugin daemon via an init system like systemd . Here's the recommended Teleport Plugin service unit file for systemd:

```bash
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-mattermost.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-mattermost.service`.

## Audit log

The plugin will let anyone with access to the Mattermost channel requests so it's
important to review Teleport's audit log.

## Feedback
