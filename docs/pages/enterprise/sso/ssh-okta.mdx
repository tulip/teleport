## How to use Okta as a single sign-on (SSO) provider for SSH

This guide will cover how to configure [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) to issue
SSH credentials to specific groups of users. When used in combination with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), it allows SSH administrators to define policies
like:

- Only members of "DBA" group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

  This guide requires a commercial edition of Teleport. The open source
  edition of Teleport only supports [Github](../../admin-guide.mdx#github-oauth-20) as
  an SSO provider.

## Enable SAML Authentication

First, configure the Teleport auth server to use SAML authentication instead of the local
user database. Update `/etc/teleport.yaml` as shown below and restart the
teleport daemon.

```yaml
auth_service:
    authentication:
        type: saml
```

## Configure Okta

First, create a SAML 2.0 Web App in Okta configuration section

### 1. Switch to Classic UI

![Switch to classic UI](../../../img/sso/okta/switch-to-classic.gif)

### 2. Select Create New App

Select Web Platform and SAML 2.0 Sign On Method.
![Create APP](../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-1.png)

## Configure the App

We are going to map the Okta groups we've created above to the SAML Attribute
statements (special signed metadata exposed via a SAML XML response).

GENERAL

- Single Sign-On URL `https://teleport-proxy.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/saml/acs`
- Audience URI (SP Entity ID)`https://teleport-proxy.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/saml/acs`
- Name ID format `EmailAddress`
- Application username `Okta username`

SINGLE ATTRIBUTE STATEMENTS

- Name: `username`  | Name format: `Unspecified` | Value: `user.login`

GROUP ATTRIBUTE STATEMENTS

- Name: `groups` | Name format: `Unspecified`
- Filter: `Matches regex` |  `.*`

### Note: RegEx requires `.*`

  Notice that we have set "NameID" to the email format and mapped the groups with a wildcard regex in the Group Attribute statements. We have also set the "Audience"
  and SSO URL to the same value.

## Create & Assign Groups

**Create Groups**

We are going to create two groups: "okta-dev" and "okta-admin":

![Create Group Devs](../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-2.1.png)

...and the admin:

![Create Group Devs](../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-2.2.png)

Assign groups and people to your SAML app:

![Configure APP](../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-3.1.png)

Make sure to download the metadata in the form of an XML document. It will be used to
configure a Teleport connector:

![Download metadata](../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-4.png)

## Create a SAML Connector

Now, create a SAML connector [resource](../../admin-guide.mdx#resources):

```yaml
(!examples/resources/saml-connector.yaml!)
```

Create the connector using the `tctl` tool:

```bash
tctl create okta-connector.yaml
```

## Create Teleport Roles

We are going to create two roles, privileged role admin who can log in as
root and is capable of administrating the cluster and non-privileged dev.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: admin
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [root]
    node_labels:
      "*": "*"
    rules:
      - resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"]
```

The developer role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [ "{{email.local(external.username)}}", ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      access: relaxed
```

- Devs are only allowed to log in to nodes labeled with `access: relaxed` label.
- Developers can log in as `ubuntu` user
- Notice `{{external.username}}` login. It configures Teleport to look at
  *"username"* Okta claim and use that field as an allowed login for each user.  This example uses email as the username format.  The `email.local(external.trait)` function will remove the `@domain` and just have the username prefix.
- Developers also do not have any "allow rules" i.e. they will not be able to see/replay past sessions or re-configure the Teleport cluster.

(!docs/pages/includes/permission-warning.mdx!)

Now, create both roles on the auth server:

```bash
tctl create admin.yaml
tctl create dev.yaml
```

## Testing

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with Okta". The CLI is
the same as before:

```bash
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

  Teleport can use multiple SAML connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=connector_name`
</Admonition>

<Admonition

  Teleport only supports sending party-initiated flows for SAML 2.0. This means you can not initiate login from your identity provider, you have to initiate login from either the Teleport Web UI or CLI.

## Troubleshooting

If you get "access denied errors" the number one place to check is the audit
log on the Teleport auth server. It is located in `/var/lib/teleport/log` by
default and it will contain the detailed reason why a user's login was denied.

Some errors (like filesystem permissions or misconfigured network) can be
diagnosed using Teleport's `stderr` log, which is usually available via:

```bash
journalctl -fu teleport
```

If you wish to increase the verbosity of Teleport's syslog, you can pass
`--debug` flag to `teleport start` command.
